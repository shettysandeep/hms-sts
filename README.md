Pre-processing and Data analysis codes for a bunch of seemingly related activities.
- handle and harmonize disparate formats of excel file submission.  
- generate reports on pdf files submitted by participating sites.
- extract metadata (such as id, etc.) from the pdf files
- check if pdf have searchable text (OCR some)
- extract information from webform surveys (received via emails)
- Of interest that I won't get to implement is application of NLP and Regex to extract information from pdf files.
