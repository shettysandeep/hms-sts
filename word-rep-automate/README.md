Code is for a specific Word template received from the client. A short turnaround task so the documenting is sparse. Used docx-python module to navigate the word doc tables and xml paths to locations in the doc that needed to be manipulated. The locations were manually searched and hardcoded to receive values from an Excel table. Working with word documents is tricky. Inserting text, highlighting, etc. moved locations of interest/text unpredictably. If there was more time, more effort would have been spent reading the manual for the module to write a more flexible (and a cleaner) code.
